# Introduction

This vignette covers the following functions:

- `process_image()`
- `scree_plot()`
- `colour_strips()`
- `make_pattern()`

These functions can be used to create a cross-stitch pattern of an image using k-means clustering and matching colours to the nearest embroidery thread colour using the `dmc()` function in the DMC [package](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/dmc). 


# K-means clustering
Let's start by taking an image and computing the k-means clustering for the pixels by RGB values and matching it to the nearest DMC thread colour.

I'll use this image:
```{r image, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics('image a1.jpg')
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
process_image <- function(image_file_name, k_list) {
#   
# #   process_image computes the k-means clustering for the pixels of an image by RGB values and matches the nearest DMC thread colour
# # 
# # Input:
# # - image_file_name: a PNG or JPEG image.
# # - k_list: the number of centres in the clustering
# # 
# # Output:
# # - cluster_info: a tibble where k_list is the k number of centers in the clustering, kclust is the output of the original k-means clustering, tidied is a summary of the k-means clustering on a per-cluster level, glanced is the single row summary, augmented is the classifications added to the original data set, and colour is the RGB with its corresponding matched DMC thread colour
# # 
# # Example:
# # image = "image_location.jpg"
# # k = c(2,4,8)
# # my_cluster <- process_image(image, k)
# 
#   
  if(!require(imager)) {
stop("The imager packages must be installed. Run install.packages(\"imager\") and then try again.")
}
  if(!require(tidyverse)) {
stop("The tidyverse packages must be installed. Run install.packages(\"tidyverse\") and then try again.")
  }
  if(!require(tidymodels)) {
stop("The tidymodels packages must be installed. Run install.packages(\"tidymodels\") and then try again.")
}
  if(!require(dmc)) {
stop("The dmc packages must be installed. Run install.packages(\"dmc\") and then try again.")
  }
  
  set.seed=(314)
  #load image
  im = load.image(image_file_name)
  
  #tidy the data
  tidy_dat = as.data.frame(im, wide="c") %>%
    rename(R=c.1, G=c.2, B=c.3)

  #only working with colours so remove the pixel coordinates for k-means clustering
  im_dat = select(tidy_dat, c(-x,-y))
  
  #k-means clustering and RGB 
  kclusts = 
  tibble(k_list) %>%
    mutate(
    kclust = map(k_list, ~kmeans(x = im_dat, centers = .x, nstart = 4)),
    tidied = map(kclust, tidy),
    glanced = map(kclust, glance),
    augmented = map(kclust, augment, tidy_dat),
    hex_colour = map(tidied , ~rgb(.x))
  )
  
  #matched DMC colours
  cluster_info = kclusts %>%
  unnest(cols = c(hex_colour)) %>%
  mutate(dmc_col = map(hex_colour, ~dmc(.x))) %>%
  unnest(dmc_col) %>%
  group_by(k_list) %>%
  nest(colour = c(hex_colour, dmc, name, hex, red, green, blue))
  
  return(cluster_info)

}
```

We can load the image by copying the file path on our computer then storing it in a variable. Since we are not certain on exactly how many clusters we should use, we can experiment with k=2,6,14 clusters. The `process_image()` function will take the image and a list of possible k number of clusters to return a tibble where for each k cluster, the corresponding k-means clustering output, a tidied summary on a per-cluster level, a single row summary, the augmented classifications added to the original data set, and the colour containing the RGB with its matched DMC thread colour are computed. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
im <- "image a1.jpg"
k = c(2,6,14)
my_cluster = process_image(im, k)
my_cluster

```

The following will demonstrate how you can access the information for k=6:

**K-means clustering output**
The cluster centers
```{r}
head(my_cluster$kclust[[2]][[2]])
```

All other available parameters
```{r}
str(my_cluster$kclust[2])
```


**Tidied output of k-means clustering**
```{r}
my_cluster$tidied[2]
```
The tidied output summarizes the k-means clustering for each RGB value with its corresponding cluster size, the total within cluster sum of squares, and its labelled cluster number.

**The clustered RGB colours and its matched DMC thread colour**
```{r}
my_cluster$colour[2]
```

The hex_colour corresponds to the hex code of the image computed by its RGB values. The dmc, name, and hex columns correspond to information for the matched DMC thread colours. 

# Scree Plot
One of the major challenges in using k-means clustering is determining the optimal number of clusters to use. A scree plot of the k number of clusters versus the total within sum of squares may be helpful. The function `scree_plot()` will take the cluster information computed above and plot its corresponding scree plot.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
scree_plot <- function(cluster_info) {
  
# 
# # scree_plot produces a plot of the k clusters versus the total within sum of squares
# # 
# # Input:
# # - cluster_info: a tibble where k_list is the k number of clusters to use for k-means clustering, kclust is the output of the original k-means 
# # clustering, tidied is a summary of the k-means clustering on a per-cluster level, glanced is the single row summary, augmented is the 
# # classifications added # # to the original data set, and colour is the RGB with its corresponding matched DMC thread colour
# # 
# # Output:
# # - a ggplot object of the k clusters versus the total within sum of squares; select the optimal number of clusters by the "elbow rule", that is, # # the bend on the plot which indicates that additional clusters beyond this kth cluster have little value
# # 
# # Example:
# # image = "image_location.jpg"
# # k = c(2,4,8)
# # my_cluster <- process_image(image, k)
# # scree_plot(my_clusters)
#


  clusterings = cluster_info %>%
    unnest(cols=c(glanced))
  
  return(ggplot(clusterings, aes(k_list, tot.withinss)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() + labs(title = "Optimal Number of Clusters", x = "Number of Clusters k", y="Total Within-Cluster Sum of Squares", caption = "Scree Plot for Different Cluster Sizes") + theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
                            panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black")))
}

```

```{r}
scree_plot(my_cluster)
```


From the scree plot, we see a bend ('elbow') at k=6 which indicates that any additional clusters beyond 6 clusters have little value. Perhaps k=6 is a good choice for k-means clustering of our image. Although identifying the elbow is subjective, we can also plot the k number of clusters against the ratio of k and (k-1) and identify the kth cluster where the relative change becomes constant or less steep to confirm our choice. 


# Colour Strips
We can see which DMC colours were clustered from our image by calling the `colour_strips()` function. The colour strips can be helpful for the `make_pattern()` function below, where we can identify the background colour of the image and set the background_colour parameter to the HEX code of the DMC thread colour to create a cross stitch pattern without the background. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colour_strips <- function(cluster_info) {
#   
# # colour_strips produces colour strips with the DMC colour closest to the cluster center colour for each k number of clusters
# # 
# # Input:
# # - cluster_info: a tibble where k_list is the k number of centres in the clustering, kclust is the output of the original k-means clustering, 
# # tidied is a summary of the k-means clustering on a per-cluster level, glanced is the single row summary, augmented is the classifications added # # to the original data set, and colour is the RGB with its corresponding matched DMC thread colour
# # 
# # Output:
# # - a ggplot object of colour strips with the DMC colour closest to the cluster center colour for each k number of centers
# # 
# # Example:
# # image = "image_location.jpg"
# # k = c(2,4,8)
# # my_cluster <- process_image(image, k)
# # my_colours <- colour_strips(my_cluster)
#
  
  colourings = cluster_info %>%
  unnest(cols = c(colour))
  
  n_col = length(colourings$hex)
  
  rect_dat <- tibble(x1 = c(0:(n_col-1)), x2 = c(1:n_col), y1 = rep(0,n_col),
                   y2 =rep(1,n_col), colour = colourings$hex)
  
  return(rect_dat %>% ggplot()  + 
    labs(caption = "Colour Strips of Matched DMC Thread") +
    geom_rect(aes(xmin=x1, xmax=x2, ymin=y1, ymax=y2, fill=colour), colour ="black")  + 
    scale_fill_manual(values = rect_dat$colour, labels=rect_dat$colour)+ theme_void() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    facet_wrap(~colourings$k_list, scales = "free", strip.position = "bottom", nrow=length(unique(colourings$k_list))))

}

```

```{r}
my_colours = colour_strips(my_cluster)
my_colours
```


We see that when we increase the number of clusters, we obtain more information and our number of colours subsequently increases. However, notice that when k=14, the colour strip shows a few repeated and similar colours. In contrast, k=6 uses fewer colours and are distinct which confirms our belief that k=6 seems like a good choice here. Of course, you can always use a very large number of clusters to obtain more information and gather more colours of the image, however this defeats the objective of clustering in which we are trying to reduce the amount of data into a lower but representative form.

# Cross-Stitching
Finally, we can plot the cross-stitched pattern of our image. Note that the cross-stitched pattern is performed on a lowered resolution of the original image such that the most common colour in the pixels will be combined to get the aggregate image and a small cluster that is not the most common colour may be dropped. 

We have a few options on how we want our cross stitch pattern to look. 

If we wish to obtain a coloured cross stitch pattern, then we just set the parameters black_white = FALSE and background_colour = NULL like so

```{r echo=FALSE}
change_resolution <- function(image_df, x_size)
{
  ## change_resolution(image_df, x_size) subsamples an image to produce
  ## a lower resolution image. Any non-coordinate columns in the data
  ## frame are summarized with their most common value in the larger
  ## grid cell.
  ##
  ## Input:
  ## - image_df: A data frame in wide format. The x-coordinate column MUST
  ##             be named 'x' and the y-coordinate column MUST be named 'y'.
  ##             Further columns have no naming restrictions.
  ## - x_size:   The number of cells in the x-direction. The number of cells
  ##             in the vertical direction will be computed to maintain the 
  ##             perspective. There is no guarantee that the exact number
  ##             of cells in the x-direction is x_size
  ##
  ## Output:
  ## - A data frame with the same column names as image_df, but with fewer 
  ##   entries that corresponds to the reduced resolution image.
  ##
  ## Example:
  ##   library(imager)
  ##   library(dplyr)
  ##   fpath <- system.file('extdata/Leonardo_Birds.jpg',package='imager') 
  ##   im <- load.image(fpath)
    # im_dat<- as.data.frame(im,wide = "c") %>% rename(R = c.1, G = c.2, B = c.3) %>%
    #          select(x,y,R,G,B)
    # agg_image <- change_resolution(im_dat, 50)
